#TODO: Create the one hot encoded to be able to do predictions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54786266/prediction-after-one-hot-encoding
#TODO: In order to do that, also need to pull elo_winner/elo_loser
# 1. User inputs name
# 2. Search through original dataset and find all matches between two players
# 3. Select match with most recent date--> get that elo_winner/elo_loser
# 4. If they havent played set to 1500 for both
